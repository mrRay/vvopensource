///	An OSCBundle is a "container" for multiple OSC messages or bundles (bundles may also be nested)
/*!
\ingroup VVOSC
According to the OSC spec, an OSC bundle is basically a wrapper for multiple OSC messages (or other bundles).  Instead of sending a bunch of individual messages, you can wrap them all into a bundle, and send the bundle (messages will still be sent to their individual address paths).  OSCBundle’s interface is correspondingly simple: you can create a bundle from some elements, or you can create a bundle and then add some elements (OSCMessages or OSCBundles) to it.

OSC bundles also have a time stamp- by default, this will be set to immediate execution (0s except for a single 1 in the LSB).  while timetag execution isn't widely supported, you may specify non-immediate time tags in the hopes that the software on the receiving end will execute the bundle in time.
